			<h1>Welcome To My Site!</h1>
			<p>This site is meant to showcase my work, and is my meant to help people get in touch with me. This is also a way for me to put my thoughts out to the world and serves as place for me to experiment with my web design, and programming hobbies.</p>

		<div id="About">
			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I'm currently a student studying Health Informatics at the University of Waterloo. Prior, to that I spent working for 3 years as a genetics tech with an amazing team, the first job I've had which I can say I've truly enjoyed. I've taken an interest in the healthcare system more generally and hope play a role in improving it in the years to come. That being said, my expertise is largely inline with my interests: medical lab genetics, genome and cancer informatics, cancer biology, health systems, biomedical data analysis.
			<br>
Aside from that I likely to think I'm a pretty friendly, open-minded person and I like meeting people and enjoy having discussions. If your curious about me, what I do, or are interested in working on something with me feel free to get in touch!
			</p>
